    "## Benefits of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "IaC replaces standard operating procedures and manual effort required for IT resource management with lines of code. Instead of manually configuring cloud nodes or physical hardware, IaC automates the process infrastructure management through source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several of the major key benefits of using an IaC solution like Terraform:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Speed and Simplicity`. IaC eliminates manual processes, thereby accelerating the delivery and management lifecycles. IaC makes it possible to spin up an entire infrastructure architecture by simply running a script.\n",
    "Team Collaboration. Various team members can collaborate on IaC software in the same way they would with regular application code through tools like Github. Code can be easily linked to issue tracking systems for future use and reference.\n",
    "* `Error Reduction`. IaC minimizes the probability of errors or deviations when provisioning your infrastructure. The code completely standardizes your setup, allowing applications to run smoothly and error-free without the constant need for admin oversight.\n",
    "* `Disaster Recovery`. With IaC you can actually recover from disasters more rapidly. Because manually constructed infrastructure needs to be manually rebuilt. But with IaC, you can usually just re-run scripts and have the exact same software provisioned again.\n",
    "* `Enhanced Security`. IaC relies on automation that removes many security risks associated with human error. When an IaC-based solution is installed correctly, the overall security of your computing architecture and associated data improves massively."

    "## Terraform Workflow\n",
    "The Terraform workflow consists of the following three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: `Write`  <br>\n",
    "In this first step in the Terraform workflow, youâ€™ll declare your infrastructure resources as code using the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: `Review` <br>\n",
    "Terraform will then display its plan to either add or remove resources predicated upon the comparison of your declared infrastructure and the current state of existing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: `Apply` <br>\n",
    "Finally, you can accept planned changes to add or remove any infrastructure resources. Your infrastructure will then be ready to be fully deployed with the help of Terraform."
